# Shopping Cart - Assignment 2
Shopping cart is a simple web application written in Java using Netbeans. This program uses the Tomcat server and is connected to the database using MySQL. The database contains information about users, products and orders.
The main function of this application is to provide an online store-like service. The user is to be able to view the products available in the store, add them to the cart and ultimately purchase them. In turn, the admin should be able to add products to the stock, edit or delete them. He will also be able to manage the users.

This project uses various technologies learned during the semester to meet the requirements for creating a functional program. These are:

- HTML and CSS to create a front end that is a friendly looking website for all users
- JSP so that the website can display the back end of the page. In other words, JSP allows you to add interactivity and immersion
- Java, which is the back end, allows you to write an entire program
- Tomcat that allows you to create a virtual server
- MySQL which saves the entire database for this program

The programs that helped in creating this project are:
- Netbeans
- XAMPP
- Git
- phpMyAdmin
